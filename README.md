# Weather App
The assignment:
✓ You should fetch data from the API using `fetch()` in JavaScript

✓ All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API

✓ The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.

✓ The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)

✓ Steps 1 & 2 should be done together and step 3 should be done in branches

## The problem
We fetched data via API from openweather and converted it to JSON. Afterwards we injected data in placeholders using inner HTML. Furthermore we created a filter so that the current weather corresponds to the background as well as the main image and description. Then we worked on creating a weekly weather forecast and polished the project with a responsive design and added additional CSS.

If we had more time we would likt to show the data from the loca time zone.
