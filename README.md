# Project: Weather App
For week three of the Technigo bootcamp (third week of the JavaScript sprint) our assignment was to create a weather web app to practice fetching APIs and displaying the fetched date. This project was made in collaboration with Petra Söderström.

## The problem
The user is able to use a city from a list for which to display the weather forcast. We fetched data via API from openweathermap.org and converted it to JSON. Afterwards we injected data in placeholders using .innerHTML. Furthermore we conditionally render the background image and icons depending on the weather and there is also a weekly weather forecast. The site is fully responsive.

If we had more time we would like to show time as local time in the selected city and have a better design for the landing page aswell as implement functionallity for displaying weather using the users location.
